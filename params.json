YOCTO project is an open source project that offers templates, tools and method to help user to create custom Linux-based systems for implant products. It was founded in 2010 as a teamwork among many hardware manufactures, open source operating systems vendors and other electronics companies some order to the chaos of embedded Linux development. The purpose of this project that it’s a complete implanted Linux development environment with tools, metadata, and documentation that people need. The YOCTO project allow its users to focus on their particular product features and development. This project produce resources and information delivers to new and experience users. It also provides pointers to example code built indicating its capabilities. \r\n\r\nThe YOCTO project sponsor by Linux Foundation. Everyone can participate in this project. There are the participants such as NXP, Wind River, OpenEmbedded eV, Texas Instruments, Intel, Long Term Support Initiative-LTSI, Juniper Networks, AMD and Mentor Graphics for Gold member.

One of the processes of YOCTO is to download the Tarball, build the Tarball and then run it. These are the codes that user need to run the data: \r\n\r\n     $ cd ~\r\n\r\n     $ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky\r\n\r\n     $ cd poky\r\n\r\n     $ git checkout -b jethro origin/jethro\r\n\r\n     $ source oe-init-build-env\r\n\r\n     $ bitbake adt-installer\r\n                        \r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n",
